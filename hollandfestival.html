                                In recent years, multimedia, visual arts, film and architecture were added to the festival roster.

            Before we as a team made the microsite, we want to take elements from the poster design and transfer it to the microsite. 
            We opted for more of an experiment type of microsite as the user can explore the microsite with their cursor all in one page. 
        </p>

        <h5>Design Elements</h5>

        <p>After deciding on the framing and problem statement, the team have a clear goal and what we should improve and add in Typology’s website.
             We decided to create a user journey to showcase the solution.
        </p>

        <h5> deconstructing composition</h5>

        <p>
            One of the main design elements are deconstructing composition. This animation makes use of the dynamic behavior of lines to create a smooth transition into the next page. This unique interaction makes it clear to the user that they are being moved to a new page. 
            The hover which displays the masked image in the text from our art direction allows the user to know that the area is interactable.

            We implemented two ways to naviagate the microsite.
            The top navigation bar can help users locate themselves within the microsite flow, but it can also help users who are not interested in exploring through the whole page to directly access the page they’re looking for.
            The mini-map serves as a secondary navigation to allow users to quickly access their desired section on the page, or even use as a ‘map’ to guide them to the desired area.
