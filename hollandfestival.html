                                In recent years, multimedia, visual arts, film and architecture were added to the festival roster.

                                The microsite's ultimate aim is to recreate the sensation of re-attending the exhibition after the fact. 
                                The microsite is more experimental in nature, and users can investigate it to simulate the experience of visiting an exhibition.

            The Ways of Water is a group exhibition hosted by Holland Festival and its purpose is to emphasize the connection between water and human kinds through different types of artworks. 
            This group exhibition features 8 different artists.
            The microsite contain two pages which is the landing page and artist page. 
            Upon landing, the user is greeted with a lobby of sorts, where they are introduced to the page with hints on how to navigate. 
            On this page, they can explore the 8 different artists on the exhibition. 
            The artist page is a more detailed page where the user can explore the different works they created in this exhibition.
             Here, they can also find more information about each piece.

        <h5>Art Direction</h5>
        <p>
            As transitioning from the poster to microsite, the team took some of the elements from the poster and implemented in the microsite.
            After deciding on an art direction for transferring to digital assets, we started a brand-new lateral process to diverge. 
            We explored alternative methods to organize material and studied interactions from precedents.
        </p>

            Introducing Microsite

        <p>
            Before we as a team made the microsite, we want to take elements from the poster design and transfer it to the microsite. 
            We opted for more of an experiment type of microsite as the user can explore the microsite with their cursor all in one page. 
        </p>

        <h5>Design Elements</h5>

        <p>After deciding on the framing and problem statement, the team have a clear goal and what we should improve and add in Typology’s website.
             We decided to create a user journey to showcase the solution.
        </p>

        <h5> deconstructing composition</h5>

        <p>
            One of the main design elements are deconstructing composition. This animation makes use of the dynamic behavior of lines to create a smooth transition into the next page. This unique interaction makes it clear to the user that they are being moved to a new page. 
            The hover which displays the masked image in the text from our art direction allows the user to know that the area is interactable.
        </p>

        <h5> Two Ways Navigation</h5>

        </figure>

        <p>
            We implemented two ways to naviagate the microsite.
            The top navigation bar can help users locate themselves within the microsite flow, but it can also help users who are not interested in exploring through the whole page to directly access the page they’re looking for.
            The mini-map serves as a secondary navigation to allow users to quickly access their desired section on the page, or even use as a ‘map’ to guide them to the desired area.
        </p>

        <h5> </h5>

        <p>
            We compared two major competitors of Typology: The InkeyList and The Ordinary, to understand what we can do and adapt to improve the current user experience.
            Inkey List provides users with an extensive ingredients index to educate them; however, this list is so complex that it makes it hard for the regular user to understand. 
            We then looked into The Ordinary and found that they give key information about each product in the PLP, but additional information was very inaccessible. 
            These observations helped us come to the decision to highlight key information in the PLP, but still give users the choice to dive deeper.
