                                    As we can see with their products the brand does only use necessary skincare ingredients that is needed for the skin without additional fragrance.

                                            From these observations, we can see that beauty product shoppers typically seek advice from social media influencers. 
                                            To dig deeper into this, we took a look at TikTok influencers and experts, because this platform has over 5.1 billion views on #acne and #acnetreatment, making one of the biggest platform for skin concerns.

These observations helped us come to the decision to highlight key information in the PLP, but still give users the choice to dive deeper.
